# pdf-chatbot-with-llama-index
A Streamlit-based app that allows users to chat with a PDF document using a query engine powered by LlamaIndex. The app takes in a PDF document, parses it using the LlamaParse library, and enables querying of the document's content with OpenAI and LlamaCloud APIs. It stores the document in memory and provides responses based on user queries.
